# 🔐 Encryption Project

A Python-based project demonstrating different encryption and decryption techniques. This project showcases classical ciphers and modern cryptographic algorithms, making it a great learning resource for understanding data security in practice.

## 🚀 Features

- **Caesar Cipher** – Encrypt and decrypt messages with character shifting.
- **Substitution & Classical Ciphers** – Simple character-based encryption.
- **RSA Algorithm** – Public-key encryption with key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** – Secure key sharing between two parties.
- **Hashing Algorithms** – MD5, SHA-1 implementation examples.
- **User-friendly CLI** – Choose encryption methods from a simple menu.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `random` – for key generation
  - `hashlib` – for hashing (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
  - `math` – for modular arithmetic (RSA, Diffie-Hellman)
